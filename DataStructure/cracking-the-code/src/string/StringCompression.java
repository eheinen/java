 * Implement a method to perform basic string comprpession using the counts of repeated chars. 
 * For example the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. 
 * If the compressed string would not become smaller than original, your method should return the original string. 
 * You can assume the string has only upper case and lowercase letters (a-z)
